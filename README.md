# misc
for cropping geotiff using regular geographic coordinates (in decimal degrees), yet getting back to a .tif so you can still import w/correct georeference. 

if you're after a jpeg/png etc., just run the script and save as image once the tif is cropped. couldn't get pixels right upon image export in the script.
